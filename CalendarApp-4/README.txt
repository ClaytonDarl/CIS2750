***
The upload button is disabled due to a bug when attempting to upload megaCal.ics, megaCal1.ics and sourceCal1.ics. If you want to use it, uncomment it in index.js. It is set up to block those 3 calendar files as well.

To Run:

Alerts will appear upon invalid entries in the database login field.

All status messages appear in the status panel

The drop down menu contains all the queries, simply select one and an input form will appear.

A4Demo.ics has been added to the uploads directory for simplicity.
